# PRODIGY_CS_01 – Caesar Cipher

## Project Overview
This is a small Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher.  
It lets the user enter a message and a shift number to move the letters forward or backward.

## Features
- Encrypt a message with any shift value
- Decrypt the message back to the original text
- Works with uppercase and lowercase letters
- Keeps spaces and punctuation unchanged

## How It Works
1. Type a message
2. Enter a shift value (integer)
3. Choose to encrypt or decrypt
4. The program prints the result

## Example
- Message: HELLO
- Shift: 3
- Mode: Encrypt
- Output: KHOOR

## Tech Used
- Python (standard library)
